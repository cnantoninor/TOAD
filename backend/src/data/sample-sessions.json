Now let's move to Phase 2 and propose architectural options.\n\n## Architectural Options for Your E-commerce Platform\n\n### **Option 1: Microservices with Event-Driven Architecture**\n\n**Technical Analysis:**\n- **Pattern**: Microservices with Domain-Driven Design\n- **Components**: Product Catalog, Order Management, Payment Processing, User Management, Inventory, Shipping\n- **Technology Stack**: Kubernetes, Docker, Node.js/TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Redis, Apache Kafka\n- **Data Flow**: Event-driven communication between services\n\n**Cost Estimation:**\n- **Development**: $350K (6 months, 8 developers)\n- **Operational**: $15K/month (cloud infrastructure)\n\n**Assumptions & Risks:**\n- Assumes team has microservices experience\n- Risk: Increased complexity for 6-month timeline\n\n### **Option 2: Monolithic with Horizontal Scaling**\n\n**Technical Analysis:**\n- **Pattern**: Modular monolith with clean architecture\n- **Components**: Single application with well-defined modules\n- **Technology Stack**: Node.js/Express, PostgreSQL, Redis, AWS ECS\n- **Data Flow**: In-process communication\n\n**Cost Estimation:**\n- **Development**: $250K (6 months, 6 developers)\n- **Operational**: $8K/month (cloud infrastructure)\n\n**Assumptions & Risks:**\n- Faster initial development\n- Risk: Harder to scale individual components\n\n### **Option 3: Serverless-First Architecture**\n\n**Technical Analysis:**\n- **Pattern**: Event-driven serverless functions\n- **Components**: Lambda functions, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3\n- **Technology Stack**: AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3, CloudFront\n- **Data Flow**: Event-driven serverless functions\n\n**Cost Estimation:**\n- **Development**: $300K (6 months, 7 developers)\n- **Operational**: $12K/month (pay-per-use model)\n\n**Assumptions & Risks:**\n- Excellent for variable load\n- Risk: Vendor lock-in and cold start latency\n\nWhich option interests you most, or would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect?"
